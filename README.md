#Python Unit Testing
A quick demonstration of Python Unit Testing, for excercises in Thinkful coursework. 

##Background
Unit tests have been created in the 'test_invoice.py' file, using python's unittest module. 
Tests are based on the test_invoice.py file, which contains a function provided from the coursework, that calculates a person's pay based on the number of hours worked and the total amount of payment for a project. 
The tests created cover basic scenarios, and are not intended to be exhaustive. 

##Execute the tests
To execute the tests: 
1) Download the project
2) In the project directory, execute: 
>> python3 test_invoice.py
3) See the results in the console

##Execute the function
To execute the function under test: 
1) In the project directory, execute: 
>> python3 invoice.py 
2) See the results for expected pay in the command line, against default values: 
Project payment = 360.0, {"
Hours worked = Alice - 3.0, Bob - 3 & Carol - 6.
